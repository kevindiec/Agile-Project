# Agile-Project

The task for this project was to utilize our knowledge of Agile, Jira and Confluence to manage a website development project. Team members worked as part of a scrum team to initiate, plan, execute, monitor, and close a sprint for a website development project where another scrum team was our customer.


# Artifacts

All these artifacts were created utilizing the Jira, Confluence and Google workspace software. The project activities and implementation were managed with Jira and Confluence. The website was then built with Google workspace software while strictly adhering to customer standards. All these pages were created with Jira, Confluence and Google workspace software to illustrate how to fully manage a project utilizing Agile Framework from start to end through the different phases of initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and closing.

The project required my team members and I to rotate roles as customer product owner, project manager/scrum master, and development team member at different points during the project. Fulfilling these different roles is important as it helps a project manager better understand the needs and functions of the rest of the scrum team. We were able to successfully elicit feedback from our customers, create updates based on the changes and present the customer with the completed project
